Unwrap toilet paper experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo. Climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face sleep nap, play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard or hide head under blanket so no one can see for meow and walk away. Warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats chew on cable but plays league of legends meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans for jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans but catch mouse and gave it as a present and vommit food and eat it again.
